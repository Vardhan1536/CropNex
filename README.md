## Introduction

Cropnex is an AI-based solution designed to assist Indian farmers by predicting daily commodity prices across 550 market centers and 22 different commodities. By utilizing over a decade of historical price data, real-time weather data, and import/export trends, we built a robust LSTM-based system that helps farmers make data-driven decisions ‚Äî from when to sell their produce to exploring nearby market options.
